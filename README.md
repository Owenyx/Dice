# Dice
Game explanation:
The game is simply called dice.
The game is played with 2 or more players.
6 dice are needed for the game.
Each player starts at 0 points.
The score typically goes to 10000 but could be adjusted if desired.
The game begins with each player rolling one die to see who goes first.
After the order is decided, the players take turns clockwise.

The scoring works as follows:
Three of any number is 100x the value of that number, except for three 1's, which is worth 1000 points.
For example, three 4's is worth 400.
If more than three of the same is rolled, the score of that three of a kind is scored for each additional number.
For example, five 6's is worth 1800 points: 600 for the three of a kind and and an additional 600 for each of the extra 6's rolled.
A 1 on its own is worth 100 points.
A 5 on its own is worth 50 points.
Rolling all 6 numbers is worth 1500 points.
Rolling three pairs is worth 1500 points.
Dice that are kept to not contribute to any hand.
For example, if a player kept a 1, and then rolled two more 1's next roll, that is NOT a three of a kind.

A given turn goes as follows:
The player rolls all 6 dice.
If they got any score, they can choose which dice to keep and therefore keep the score associated.
The player can then choose to roll the remaining dice that were not kept, or to end thier turn and keep any score accumulated during thier turn.
If all six dice were rolled and scored, the player may choose to roll all 6 again and repeat the process, or end thier turn with the score they have accumulated.
If any roll during the turn results in no score, the turn ends and the player gets no score at all.
If the player is below 1000 points, they cannot choose to end thier turn and keep thier points. They must keep rolling until they have at least 1000.
If a player chooses to end thier turn and keep X score, the next player has the option to start thier turn with X score already accumulated, but they also start with however many dice the previous player had left.
Any player with less than 1000 score does not have this option and must start each turn with no accumulated score and all 6 dice.
Players must score exaclty 10000 points to win. 
If they score more than 10000, thier turn ends and all score accumulated that turn is lost. 
Additionally, if a given roll would go over 10000 points if all score from that roll was kept, then the player is forced to keep all of the score and therefore bust.

Turn flow:
1. Start with 6 active dice
2. Roll all active dice
3a. If any score is rolled, the player chooses to keep any scoring combination of dice and must keep some score.
3b. If no score is rolled, the turn ends and the player gets no score at all.
4. The player now has the option to repeat from step 2 with the remaining dice that were not kept, or to end thier turn and keep any score accumulated during thier turn. They can only choose the end turn option if they have at least 1000 points.
5. If all 6 dice are kept, the player has the option to repeat from step 1 with all 6 dice again, or to end thier turn and keep any score accumulated during thier turn.
6. If at any point during the turn, keeping all scoring dice from a roll would put the player's total score over 10000 points, then the player is forced to keep all scoring dice and therefore bust, ending their turn with no points accumulated.
7. If the player chooses to end thier turn and keep X score, the next player has the option to start thier turn with X score already accumulated, but they also start with however many dice the previous player had left. This option is not available to players with less than 1000 points.
8. If a player scores exactly 10000 points, they win the game.
